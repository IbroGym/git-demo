sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their choosen battle field

Form the lines
Shield by shield
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word

Oh I used to say
I would never fall in life again
Until I found her
I found you

Only know you've been high when it take it slow
Never touch and never to keep calm deep
